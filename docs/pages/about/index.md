# Statement

Andrew creates minimalist ceramic forms using porcelain and high fired stoneware. He employs a colour palette from pure white through to vivid primary colours. He enjoys both the technical challenge of ceramics and the tactile quality of the finished surface.

Andrew’s work is divided into a number of different series which vary from forms made on the wheel which reference traditional pottery to abstract sculptural pieces. Some are intended as large single pieces while others form groups of related objects where no two are alike.

Evidence of process is an important consideration and the memory of the hand is still visible in the final works and is a vital part of their nature. Working with the minimal use of tools allows Andrew to investigate the balance between control and the element of chance and how these seemingly opposite qualities can be combined in a complementary way.
